Implemented your own Neural Network from scratch, in Python, used Pytorch to implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 

Trained your network on the CIFAR10(The CIFAR-10 dataset (Canadian Institute For Advanced Research) is a collection of images that are commonly used to train machine learning and computer vision algorithms) dataset.
